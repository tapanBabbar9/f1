# Predicting F1 Lap Times: A Comparison of ML Models

## Overview

This project aims to predict Formula 1 (F1) lap times using various machine learning models. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed F1 race data, including lap times, race results, and pit stops. We compare multiple machine learning algorithms to determine which model best predicts lap times, taking into account factors like circuit conditions, pit stops, and temporal dependencies.
